- Basic physical movement + flying mode 
- Texture-mapped voxels
- Day-night transition
- User inventory


## Logistics
Contents:

- assets: all of the images/assets used in our VoxCraft world including textures and icons
- components: all of the A-frame components used in our project - these drive the logic behind our program
- shaders: shader for the day/night sky gradient in our background
- utils: a perlin noise library that we used to generate our infinitely random landscape
- aframe.js: an A-frame library - literally A-frame itself
- index.html:thee organizational hierarchy of all the components and entities used in our project
