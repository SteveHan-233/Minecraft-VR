### Infinite Terrain 
- Display 5x5 grid of chunks 
- Generate and render new chunks as user walks around
- Store changes to old chunks
- Perlin noise
- Different voxel textures from texture atlas (by [Joshtimus](https://www.minecraftforum.net/members/Joshtimus)) according to height 
- Randomly generate trees/lanterns

### Building and Mining
- Create your own (virtual) reality 
- Pull trigger to build block on the selected face
- Repeatedly move your arm across a block to mine it. Itâ€™s an arm work out.

## Logistics
Contents:

- assets: all of the images/assets used in our VoxCraft world including textures and icons
- components: all of the A-frame components used in our project - these drive the logic behind our program
- shaders: a shader for the day/night sky gradient in our background
- utils: a Perlin noise library that we used to generate our infinitely random landscape
- aframe.js: an A-frame library - literally A-frame itself
- index.html: the organizational hierarchy of all the components and entities used in our project
